#Analysis and Graphing
In Analysis and Graphing BCB546 Group Project.Rmd you will find the R Markdown code for the graphing and data analysis sections of our group project. We test the few parts of the authors analysis that were avaliable to us as well as graph a number of demographic and descriptive statistics.

General linear models were used to test the significance reported by the authors of our selected paper. 

A .html file of the RMarkdown is also avaliable in this repository.
